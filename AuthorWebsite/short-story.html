        In the meadow far strewn were lilies burning yellow, blades of grass, a lake rainformed. The day was clear. All birds were chirping. Clouds cast their visage over the water, their reflections beaming with violence as they cross into the stark, fiery divide of green blades that sway, and as they sway they resound their own hymn. And the breeze whistles in the meadow as though songs she whispers; nor music, nor reason, nor imagery does she exhale from her sacred and elusive cavern, cryptic and unlocatable for the living, nevertheless, she, with beauty alone, exiles any from their condition: an elk emerges from ponderosa pine, fallen trees, and boulders engorged in emerald lichen alongside deer and doe, he trots in silence toward the water. Squirrels skit fast across patchworks of white and yellow pedals, regal butterflies, broken boughs without damaging anything over which they trod, then they stand erect in moments above the verdure wiggling their little noses, then, from a sudden, dash again and disappear in the shade. Little birds seeking critters burgeoning from the upper crust of soil fly in small groups, then, upon one’s talons over the floor, the rest follow. Another set of little birds, plump in their bellies and fine in their beaks and stern gaze, graze vertically by the side of trees as they grip with their little talons the bark, tilt backwards and wind their force, then release to peck and break bark in search. Curious calves emerge from a grove with their mothers not far behind, and as they set their vision upon those who graze, they wag their tails. The mothers were grazing then dipped themselves in the water, then they looked at their reflections. Off in the shade, beneath thick canopies from whence sunlight broke through with dim light gilded, was a patch devoid of grass and filled with loose soil; a red bull walked toward it, huffing and examining the ground beneath him once there, his horns curved, acute, and dense, then, turning his head in the direction of the meadow, he stomped his right hoof and withdrew it immediately, then, with this one swift motion, soil scattered above him as he bathed himself in earth, moving his head to and fro, huffing now with alto tone.

But grey overcame azure skies and put to rout bird heartfelt lullabies. The ground trembled, reflections in the water distorted, every living thing sought to hide in the open: uncertain, scared, paralyzed. The boughs fell. And the cattle withdrew from the water; the calves scuttled with their bodies too big for them to hide behind their mothers’ legs, the bull made way one direction and the rest of the herd followed. The elk, too, was trotting away, and the doe and deer followed. The music disappeared. And in the sky the planets aligned, for the sun had been blacked out, and over the floor shadows from the trees distorted into crescent images, shifting with the motion of the planets. Over the water, in the distance, a singular hawk flew beneath the fantastic, his shadow becoming two, even three. Then, from beneath the complicated web of pine needles and boughs, dense in their composition over the soil, the earth shook with violence; therein reverberated a sound beneath it all, ancient with language unheard: what is beyond understanding. And from that very pace of pine needles and dead boughs tightly wound she rose. Her eyes were hazy, sapphire; her hair black, straight, and to her shoulders; she was vested in a toga mysteriously white; her skin was pale and her lips crimson; she wore no shoes. And as she walks from that hole in the earth, with each step further therefrom, the hole coagulated in forestry again; shadows began drifting from their confusion becoming singular per thing, and the planets began to unalign. Alas, it is the Sybil, and before her time reaches an end she walks into the meadow and dips her toes into the water. There, she peers into her reflection, thus sang she:

“                    ”

And lo, so terrible is her song that a bird fell from the sky to the ground beside her feet, for in her tune was everything ever to be known, every dream had, every longing, for she sang not with words, but in the way. And there, over the water, when she saw the nightingale breathless beside her, tears fell from her sapphire eyes. And when the sky was opening again, as she was peering into her reflection, she was watching herself disappear: in certain spots her body was shifting fro and to opacity and transparency, and she saw all was changing about her save her eyes, philosopher’s stones with antique primordiality.
