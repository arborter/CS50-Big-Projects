This is a simple website that utilizes HTML and CSS.

Purpose of this site:
I am a novelist, so I decided to take this opportunity with CS50 to develop a simple template for my upcoming professional site, and to familiarize myself with what such a site would look like at a very fundamental level. 

Anatomy of this site:
This site is composed of one of my poems (poem.html), one of my short stories (short-story.html), one of the passages from my novella EMÃ˜CEAN (index.html), and a mock about page. Moreover, each page contains a text box with a submit button for the purpose of posting comments, though its operation has not been implemented. There is also a navigation bar (nav.html).

What I learned:
I learned how to create a webpage from scratch and how to host it via localhost for testing.

What it still needs:
When I use this template to create my professional author site, I will implement JavaScript to make the text box operational for the purpose of posting comments.
