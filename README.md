Big Projects
 
This repository is a documentation of my learning web application development and design. The folders within showcase my ability to use the Flask framework, HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, and JSON. 

NOTA BENE:
These projects use the CS50 header. The CS50 header was specially made for the CS50 course.
